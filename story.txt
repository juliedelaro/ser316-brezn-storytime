On a sunny afternoon, a lone traveler went searching for an authentic Bratwurst. He was driving his porsche down Hauptsrtasse wearing his lederhose.
He put the top down to get some sunshine as he listened to his favorite band Rammstein. “Truly, the best time of the year in Berlin,” the traveler thought, as the comforting aroma of the nearby baeckerei washed through his car. The aroma from the gaebaeck caused the now distracted traveler to crash into the front gate of a nearby schloss.
