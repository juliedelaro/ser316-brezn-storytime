On a sunny afternoon, a lone traveler went searching for an authentic Bratwurst. He was driving his porsche down Hauptsrtasse wearing his lederhose.
He put the top down to get some sunshine as he listened to his favorite band Rammstein. “Truly, the best time of the year in Berlin,” the traveler thought, as the comforting aroma of the nearby baeckerei washed through his car. The 
traveler continued down Hauptsraasse, when another traveler driving a BMW started revving his engine directly beside
him.
