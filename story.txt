On a sunny afternoon, a lone traveler went searching for an authentic Bratwurst. He was driving his porsche down Hauptsrtasse wearing his lederhose.
He put the top down to get some sunshine as he listened to his favorite band Rammstein. “Truly, the best time of the year in Berlin,” the traveler thought, as the comforting aroma of the nearby baeckerei washed through his car. He pulled over to the baeckeri and went inside. Since that day, he has brought his friends and family to the same baeckeri.
