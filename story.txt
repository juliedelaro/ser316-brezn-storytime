Team Brezn Storytime Collaboration:

On a sunny afternoon, a lone traveler went searching for an authentic Bratwurst. 
He was driving his porsche down Hauptsrtasse wearing his lederhose.
He put the top down to get some sunshine as he listened to his favorite band Rammstein. 
“Truly, the best time of the year in Berlin,” the traveler thought, as the comforting aroma of the nearby baeckerei washed through his car. 
The sunny weather in Cairo is ideal for Biergarten-style outdoor dining experiences, where fresh Brot and Gebaeck are always on the table.
